    <p> Welcome to my profile. </p>

    <p>My name is Irving. I have a passion for riding bike and learning new things. Each passion or interest I have always leads to new opportunities as an entrepreneur. It was my love for cycling that motivated me to start a clothing brand called fixmylife back in 2013. Fast foward to 2018, fixmylife has evolved into a online bike shop (fmlcycling.com). The start of my clothing brand opened up a world of possibilities when it came to being creative. It lead me to get a job in screen printing and learn the skills i needed to help the brand move foward by reducing cost and improving quality. It lead me to learning how to design on adobe illustrator. In my understanding of business you can't always cut out the middle man to keep production moving, but knowing how to do the work for yourself will help you understand the process better and recieve better quality from the companies providing you the service.</p> 

<p>After screen printing, I started working as a bike messenger which helped push my business foward. This also allows me the time for a job since i mostly cater to bike messenger with the bikes and products i sell. In 2016 I came out with a prototype bicycle brand named Duran Cycles. After selling all the bicycle frames, I decided to take a pause on the brand to continue to work on other projects. One of those other projects include building handheld gaming systems base of the raspberry pi, which is a single board computer. I started getting in touch with my childhood. Working on these projects i got a taste of coding Python and C programming. I realised the things i could do were limited by the knowledge I have for coding and that lead me to wanting to learn coding, to further improve my projects and hopefully follow a career in computer programming.</p>
